	The slash star means this is all a comment!

	A little review

	Variables:
		
		Declaration:
			
			var someVarName = "A value!";

		Types:
	
			Variables can hold different data types,
			the ones we've talked about are...
			1. Numbers (var myVar = 37;)
			2. Booleans (var myVar = false;)
			3. Strings (var myVar = "Hello, world!";)

	Functions:

		Without parameters:

			function myFuncName() {
				// any code in here gets executed when you call myFuncName()
			}
		
		With parameters:

			function myFuncWithParams(param1, param2, bob) {
				// any code in here gets executed when you call myFuncWithParams()
				// Inside this function, you have access to the values passed in as parameters
				// e.g. var bobPlusOne = bob + 1;
			}

	If/else statement:

		if( some condition ) {
			// code in here gets executed if the condition is true
		} else {
			// code in here gets execued if the condition is not true
		}

		Example:

			if(myVar == "banana") {
				console.log("It's banana");
				numberOfBananas = numberOfBananas + 1;
			} else {
				console.log("It's not banana");
			}

	While loop:

		while( some condition ) {
			// code in here gets executed as long as the condition is true
			// the computer checks the condition before each time,
			// and if it is true, runs the code inside again
		}

		Example:

			while(3 > 2) {
				alert("Infinite loop!!!!");
			}

	For loop:

		for( initialization ; condition ; counter update ) {
			// the for loop header has 3 parts
			// initialization is where you set some counter variable's starting value
			// condition is the condition that is checked each time to see
			// if the code in the loop should run again
			// counter update is where your counter variable's value is updated
		}

		Example:
			
			for(i = 0; i < 10; i = i + 1) {
				alert("Hello! The value of i is now " + i);
			}

	Arrays:

		Declaration:
			
			var myCoolArray = [ 4, 3, "apple", false ];
	
		Accessing:

			// Remember, the first index of an array is 0!

			myCoolArray[0]; // this is 4
			myCoolArray[2]; // this is "apple"
			myCoolArray[1] > 2; // myCoolArray[1] is 3, so this evaluates to true

		Setting:

			myCoolArray[0] = "hello"; // now myCoolArray[0] is "hello" instead of 4
			myCoolArray[4] = "goodbye"; // added a new item, "goodbye", onto the end of the array

		Length:

			We didn't cover this before, but arrays have an attribute called length,
			that holds the number of elements in the array.

			myCoolArray.length; // 5, after adding on "goodbye"

	Now read the problems below and modify the code to solve them.

/*
	Problem 1: Just load example_1.html in a browser and run this function by
	clicking the corresponding button.
*/

function problem1() {
	alert("Problem 1 solved!");
}

/*
	Problem 2: Modify the function below so that instead of alerting "Hello"
	twice, it alerts "Hi, there!" 3 times.
*/

function problem2() {
	
	for(i = 0; i < 2; i = i + 1) {
		alert("Hello");
	}

}

/*
	Problem 3: Modify the function below so that instead of logging all values
	from 1 to 10, it logs every OTHER value
*/

function problem3() {

	for(i = 1; i <= 10; i = i + 1) {
		console.log(i);
	}

}

/*
	Problem 4: Modify the function below so, when you run it, the output is:

	apple
	orange
	banana
*/

function problem4() {
	
	var fruitArray = ["apple", "orange", "banana"];

	console.log(fruitArray[0]);
	console.log(fruitArray[1]);
	// add a line here!

}

/*
	Problem 5: Look at the function below and try to predict what happens when you run it.
	Then, modify the function so that when you run it, the output is:

	apple
	orange
	banana
*/

function problem5() {
	
	var fruitArray = ["apple", "orange", "banana"];

	for(int i = 0; i < 2; i = i + 1) {
		console.log(fruitArray[i]);
	}

}

/*
	Problem 6: The function below is supposed to count the number of apples and bananas
	in the array fruitArray. However, it doesn't correctly count the apples yet.
	Read through the code and try to understand what's happening.
	Then, modify the function so that it correctly counts and displays
	the number of bananas and apples.
*/

function problem6() {
	
	var fruitArray = ["apple", "apple", "banana", "apple", "apple", "banana", "orange", "banana"];

	var numBananas = 0;
	var numApples = 0;

	for(i = 0; i < fruitArray.length; i = i + 1) {

		if(fruitArray[i] == "banana") {
			numBananas = numBananas + 1;
		}
		
		if(fruitArray[i] == "apple") {
			// add a line here!
		}

	}
	
	console.log("Number of bananas: " + numBananas);
	console.log("Number of apples: " + numApples);

}

/*
	Problem 7: Hello, world!

	Using the existing code in example_1.html and this file as an example,
	write a Hello, world! program. You should create a new button in the html,
	that when clicked, runs a function (that you write) called problem7. The function problem7
	should log the words "Hello, world!" to the console.

// Add some code here!
